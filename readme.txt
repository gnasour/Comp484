Very Basic front end components

The dealer message is to the right of the buttons so if you do not see them after all players have done something then scroll to the right of the screen.

The dealer message is designed to tell you what is happening on certain actions i.e. did you score a blackjack, did you bust, did the dealer win, etc...

If the screen is too small the dealer will deal cards to the left hand of the player instead of the right. I dont do front end.
